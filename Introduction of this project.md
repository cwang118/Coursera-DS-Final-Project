# Coursera-DS-Final-Project
Analysis of Taxi trips reported to the City of Chicago

This project for my Coursera IBM Applied Data Science Capstone
Week 4&5 Final Project

1. Introduction

1.1 The research problem and background
Taxi is one of the most important urban trip model, however, when we are planning a trip riding a Uber or Lyft vehicle, we can see an estimated price if we try navigation APPs like Google Map. This is a project motivated by the lack of taxi trip cost estimation supported by APPs. Also, how do taxi drivers maximize their probability to get more business? The fact of this market of rideshare is dominated by Uber and Lyft by 2018, the market share in reimbursement of taxi decreased to 5.2% by Q2 of 2018. This project is trying to figure out the patterns of taxi trips origins and destinations in a day.

1.2 Data description
Similar research with Taxi data in New York City is available in Kaggle hosted in partnership with Google Cloud and Coursera 2 years ago, I am going to use a similar data from Chicago with more metrics including not only geographic coordinates, time and travel costs, but also payment method and taxi company available from Chicago Data Portal https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew. Also, by using geopy library, it is possible to transfer the coordinates to neighbourhood and address in Chicago, more cluster analysis is unlocked this way.
